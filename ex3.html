<h1>This example is about making lists</h1>
<em>Here's what I like about lists:</em>

<ul>
  <!-- Notice no p tag in the li items.  -->
  <li>
    They're useful for displaying lists of stuff
  </li>
  <li>That's about it</li>
  <li>
    I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>When you make a list, do it in this order:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
  <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
  <li>
    Use li tags nested in the list for your list items
    <ul>
      <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
      <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
